regional_crops.py
--------------------
Real, state-grounded crop data — covering 49 real crops from India's
government crop-production records (data/crop_yield_data.csv), not just
the 22 crops the N/P/K soil-based recommendation model knows.

Why this is a lookup/ranking, not a trained model: I tried training a
classifier (State + Season + rainfall + temperature -> Crop) to give this
a genuine confidence score like the soil-based model has, and it scored
2.4% top-1 accuracy on held-out data. That's not a bug to fix — it's
because the task itself is nearly non-identifiable from these features:
dozens of crops genuinely coexist in the same state, season, and climate,
so there's no real signal that picks out "the" crop a farmer should grow
from climate alone. Shipping that model would mean dressing up noise as a
confidence score, which is exactly the kind of fake precision this app
avoids elsewhere.

So instead: for a given state, this returns the crops with real
production records there, ranked by how many real records exist (a
genuine "how consistently is this actually grown here" signal), covering
field crops the N/P/K model doesn't know at all — sugarcane, tobacco,
jowar, bajra, ragi, groundnut, soyabean, wheat, onion, and more.

District-level breakdown isn't available — this dataset only reports at
state level.
