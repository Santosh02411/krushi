disease_reference.py
----------------------
A symptom-matching reference tool for common crop diseases — NOT an image
classifier. I looked for a real, freely-usable pretrained plant-disease
image model to bundle here (found one: a fastai-exported ResNet34 trained
on PlantVillage, from github.com/imskr/Plant_Disease_Detection). It's not
used, because fastai 1.x (which that .pkl export requires to even
unpickle) is unmaintained and doesn't install cleanly on modern Python —
shipping it would mean either a broken dependency or a feature that
silently doesn't work, which is exactly the kind of fake-functional thing
this project is trying to avoid.

Instead, this module matches farmer-described symptoms (leaf color/pattern,
spots, wilting, powdery coating, etc.) against a reference table of common
diseases per crop, sourced from standard published plant-pathology/
extension-service knowledge. The photo upload/camera capture in the UI is
real and works, but the photo is kept for the farmer's own reference only
— it is not analyzed by this module. If a real image-classification API
key is added later, that can slot in alongside this without removing it.
